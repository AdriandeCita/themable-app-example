# The actual application that uses our styled components

Imagine I play quake 3 arena with my friends every friday. I want to create a simple list which contains some game stats and allows me easily filter and sort data.

## Roadmap

- Simple component usage (i.e button with text and icon)
- Advanced component usage (transaction list)
